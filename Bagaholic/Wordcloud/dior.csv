I don't like the stitching on the front & I feel like @dior always discontinues styles like this fairly quickly!
Can see it being a classic amongst the taitai. Any ah girl trying to rock this will have to try hard to make it look young! Also agree with all the comments about the stitching.
"I love it, itâ€™s beautiful, but I wonâ€™t be purchasing one myself, there are too many other bags already in my wardrobe & on my wish list that fulfil the same purpose. Iâ€™ll definitely be appreciating it from afar.ðŸ˜"
I prefer diorever than this new one ðŸ˜‚

@azuragwynne ðŸ˜
Thanks for sharing but I will pass... the style of the bag is too Â«Â casualÂ Â» ( or oldish)and if the leather is thin and subject to crease itâ€™s an abs no way. I was expecting something new and still great quality... why so boring Dior ( my last bag the Montaigne tho) I expect more from themðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚â¤ï¸ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜

Oh my gooooooooddddnnnes
Omg that test drive one is so small and cute!
Someone on YT brought up the fact that Dior keeps changing the font/setup of their logo. I was curious how you felt about that? It definitely makes things like belts a less appealing purchase because they will date quickly vs say the Hermes H buckle...
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ @sitiarbaiya a new addition?

"That's the cutest, when will we have it in sg"
Those prints are intense
My SA informed me a couple of days ago that Dior has cancelled the medium sized book totes and will instead launch them sometime in 2020. Is this true? They had a prelaunch event in Japan a couple months back. Iâ€™ve been waiting for a smaller size ðŸ˜¢
@amandawang___ shd I
Well done!
That olive saddle ðŸ”¥
#diorxbagaholicboy #diorbooktote #diorsaddle

That green saddle! ðŸ’š ðŸ˜
The friendship band in green is major ðŸ’š
will it comfortably fit a B30?
How much
Do you know whether Europe will launch the small book tote ahead of Asia ?
My SA just told me today that the launching of the small book tote in Hong Kong will be delayed until end of 2019 or early 2020. Do you know the launching time in Eurip
@amyyapseechen
I wish I had gotten this instead of the classic size! I like the classic but itâ€™s not suitable for anywhere but work or travel due to size. It gets very heavyðŸ™ˆ.
Can you put a size by size comparison with the original tote? ðŸ˜
I much prefer the smaller size! Hope Dior will come up with more designs in the smaller size soon!

"this or the goyard for school? ðŸ¤ª thank you, sayang @yokomucha ðŸ˜˜"

Can you do a mod shot? ðŸ˜˜
"ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Could you sling on shoulder?"
do you know if you will be able to put your name on the small size?
Is name customisation available?
Is it heavy?
ðŸ’™ðŸ’š

Do you know the price for this??ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
